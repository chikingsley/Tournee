### **The Core Concept**

Keglerz is a **paperless sidepot management system** for bowling leagues and tournaments. It replaces paper sheets and laptops with a mobile app system.

* **For Organizers:** An iOS/Mac app to set up games, enter scores, and manage money.
* **For Bowlers:** A free iOS/Android app to view standings and results in real-time.

### **1. Supported Sidepots & Games**

The app supports all standard betting formats in both **Scratch** and **Handicap** modes:

* **Brackets:** Includes logic to minimize duplicate pairings and generates "Still Alive" or Refund reports.
* **High Game (Nassau):** Supports individual game pots and total pinfall payouts.
* **Blind-Draw Doubles:** Randomizes partners while avoiding duplicates.
* **Eliminator:** Manages "cut" scores where bowlers are eliminated each game.
* **Tournament Scoring:** General scoring management.

### **2. Features for Organizers (The "EMS")**

* **Mobility:** Run the whole tournament from an iPhone, iPad, or M1 Mac. No laptop or printer required.
* **Easy Setup:** Import bowler names/averages from previous events or pre-set leagues (includes lane assignments).
* **Money Management:**
  * Tracks all money collected.
  * Calculates payouts automatically.
  * Identifies refunds (e.g., if a bowler paid for more brackets than were filled).
* **Flexible Score Entry:**
  * **Admin Entry:** Uses a quick-entry custom keypad.
  * **Bowler Entry:** Option to let bowlers enter their own scores via their phones (saved to the server).

### **3. Features for Bowlers (The "Client")**

* **Real-Time Standings:** Bowlers check results on their own phones (Android or iOS) immediately.
* **No Crowds:** Eliminates the need to walk to the "wall" or table to see paper printouts.
* **Event Discovery:** Users can see active events within a 75-mile radius.

### **Summary of Tech Specs**

* **Organizer Platform:** iPhone, iPad, Mac (M1 chip or newer).
* **Bowler Platform:** Any modern iPhone or Android device.
* **Connectivity:** Uses Cloud/Client-Server technology to sync data instantly between the organizer and all bowlers.
